# medhacks2020

## Get ready to code
1. [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
2. Go to your Documents folder or your favorite file location
3. Using git bash: `git clone https://github.com/schance995/medhacks2020.git`

## Now you're ready
You can also do this with git GUI but I can't help you as much with that.
1. Write code, make changes, have fun!
2. `git add .` to stage your changes
  - if you did this too early it's fine: `git reset` to unstage changes
3. `git commit -m "describe your changes here"` to save your changes to the log
4. `git push origin master` to update them to the master repository

## Notes
- git is decentralized version control, so when one person makes an update everyone has to download the update using `git pull`
- I don't expect us to learn how to pull and fork in one day (the proper way to work on a collaborative git project). This is a small project so it doesn't matter but let's try to avoid working on too many parts of the code at once so we can reduce the chances of errors of code mismatching (these are a pain to fix)
- Please check the google doc for more information aobut our project.
